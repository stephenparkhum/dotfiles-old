# My dotfiles

Exactly what it sounds like!

## Purpose

The main reason I created this repo is so that I can spin up on new client systems way more efficiently than before.

Essentially, the `setup_env.sh` script

### Instructions

Note: you probably _shouldn't_ run this script without really looking at what it does, but feel free to look at my dotfiles.

1. Clone repo to local system
2. From root of project run `bash setup_env.sh`
